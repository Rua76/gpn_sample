This is a sample code to show how to load and use pretrained gpn model to generate prediction on input sequence, and how to extract embeddings

It assume you are working on midway3

## 1. install gpn on your working environment with pip
```
pip install git+https://github.com/songlab-cal/gpn.git
```
## 2. clone gpn github repository, and jump to the work directory
